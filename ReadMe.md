# Project name: Python Data Structures

## Description  
Implementation of data structures with ``Python`` using ``Hashing`` and ``Binary Search Tree``.  
The project was done by using Visual Studio Code and GitLab.  

## Background and idea
This is a Python project I did as a graduation project in a course called ``Introduction to Programming`` in university, where we learned Python programming to a acceptable level. This course was also the first course I had in Computer Engineering.  
There were a few other Python tasks in this project as well, but they were pretty simple for me, but I've added them to the ``tasks`` folder if you want to check. In those simple tasks, we were suppose to write 2 programs that print the word count of 2 txt files filled with words, how many different words used in txt files, the top 10 most used words and how many times those words were used.  
However, the main purpose of the project was to ``perform simple data structures using Hashing and Binary Search Tree``. In this main task, we were given 2 completely empty files with only the names of the functions we will use. These were ``BstMap.py`` and ``HashSet.py``. The ``bst_main.py`` and ``hash_main.py`` files were given completely ready. It was our task to create the ``dataclasses`` that could run the main files, and to create and write functions with the given names.  
The project was normally a group work, but since my colleague decided to drop out of the course, I had to start and finish the project alone.  
This project got a ``grade B`` with the F-A grading system.
